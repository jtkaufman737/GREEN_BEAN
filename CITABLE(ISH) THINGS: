CITABLE(ISH) THINGS:

The only specific things I 'copied' so to speak were syntax patterns. As by nature these had to be changed to reflect my own variables & code, I didn't utilize anything verbatim.

Derek assisted me specifically in some of the css styling: although more in a conceptual way regarding some of the height & percentage interactions for my tile divs that show the x's and o's. 

Josie specifically corrected one instance of me using an assigning = where I needed a ==.
