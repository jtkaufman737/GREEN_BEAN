# GREEN_BEAN

Welcome to my tic-tac-toe game! While hardly a unique early project for an aspiring developer,
I found it really interesting, gratifying, frustrating, and fun. 

This site utilizes a mix of CSS, HTML, and vanilla Javascript to establish a grid where
through alternating turns players mark an x or o by clicking. If one player reaches three
x's or o's, they've won and the game restarts itself. 

I would say this project suffers from one formal remaining problem: a minor bug that occurs
the third refresh of the game. I think I've come close to finding the culprit but unfortunately
did not develop a foolproof fix before my technical demonstration. I would say the remainder
of tweaks are less unsolved problems than enduring options -- I am looking forward to adding features
like a start button, master scoreboard to count total names won, as well as some animation features
that would give visual cues as to whose turn it is.
