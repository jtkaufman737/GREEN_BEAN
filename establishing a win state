establishing a win state

onclick // append an array (tile1a, tile1b, tile1c)

tileOne    tileTwo    tileThree
tileFour   tileFive   tileSix
tileSeven  tileEight  tileNine

In evenAndOdd function, I want to add something onclick that lets me retrieve them ...
Push there somewhere to be stored
At the end of each even and odd turn, I want the place they are stored to check for combinations
If they get the right combination it would be a win state
